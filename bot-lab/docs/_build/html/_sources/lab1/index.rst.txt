**F5 XC Console**

F5 XC Console is a SaaS control-plane for F5 XC services that provides a UI and API for managing network, security, and compute services.

F5 XC Console can manage "sites" in existing on-prem data centers and sites in AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud environments.

Using F5 XC Console, an end-user can centrally manage a distributed application environment.

Lab 1 - Exercise 2: Select your Persona
---------------------------------------

#. Please log into your assigned Volterra tenant. https://f5-sales-public.console.ves.volterra.io/

    .. note:: The VoltConsole GUI has a relatively short timeout. This is not configurable. We have an enhancement request to allow this to be configured.

#. The first time that you login you will need to select your "persona"

   Enter your persona as "SecOps" and level as "Intermediate".  You can change these settings after logging in as well.

   Your persona will highlight workflows within Volterra.  You will be able to access all services, but making use of
   personas can focus your view on particular tasks that are relevant to your role.

#. Several tooltips will appear.  You can close these out.
