Lab 2: Exploiting automated threats against F5 Airlines
=======================================================

During this lab you will be running automated attacks against the F5 Airline web presence in order to understand the tactics and techniques leveraged by advesaries.

We will be using the F5 Automation Lab UDF image to exploit the following scenarios:

- Credential Stuffing (OAT-008_) attack against the F5 airlines login form - Using automation to validate a list of stolen credentials found on the darknet attempting to identify users who have used the same username and password on the F5 Airlines web portal - with the intention of stealing frequent flyer points.
- Card Cracking (OAT-010_) attack against the F5 airline credit card portal - Using automation to validate a list of stolen credit card numbers by attempting to process a very small transaction with each.
- Scraping (OAT-011_) attack against the F5 airline flight seasrch interface - Using automation to scrape flight pricing.
