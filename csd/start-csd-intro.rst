F5 Distributed Cloud Client Side Defense: Prevent Skimming and Formjacking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like credit card skimming in the physical world, cybercriminals have developed attacks to take ownership of legitimate websites and install digital skimming to steal credit card numbers, social security numbers, national identity numbers, names, addresses, login credentials, and other personally identifiable information.

Chief information security officers (CISOs) face a client-side security gap that puts their customersâ€™ privacy and financial well-being at risk. With Magecart-like criminal attacks against websites causing massive breaches, government fines, and loss of customer confidence, the challenge of keeping customers safe online needs urgent attention.

Client-Side Monitoring, Detection, and Mitigation
-------------------------------------------------
Distributed Cloud Client-Side Defense has two core components that establish its efficacy:

JavaScript that captures signals and a machine learning analysis service that processes those signals.
